    <p>
      In this classic strategy board game, players take it in turns to place
      counters, to capture their opponent's pieces and convert them to their
      colour. The player with the most pieces when the board fills up is the
      winner. The rules are simple, but complex strategies can emerge!
    </p>
    <p>
      In Flippy, you pick your colour and play against a computer opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This game is from the book 'Making Games with Python and Pygame'.
